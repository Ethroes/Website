			During competition build season and off season projects, Team 2471 has come across the need for a compact and low cost gearbox. Occasionally it is 
			desirable to have some sort of breakaway torque in cases where the mechanism being driven can jam on a field element or game piece. This is small, 
			light weight and low cost gearbox with an adjustable torque breakaway limit which is suitable for many FRC applications.
