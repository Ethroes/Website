				<td> <font size="3" color="black">Each major competition costs $5,000 for registration. The team schedules two major competitions per year, three if the team qualifies for World Championships. Cash funding makes this possible. Cash sponsors are recognized in a variety of ways, including the team web site, banners, shirts and logos on the robots. Team 2471 likes to visit sponsors each year during the off season to show what their sponsorship has accomplished. Click the "Funds" button above to get started!</font></td>
				<td> <font size="3" color="black">Parts, tools and materials are always welcome. Cast offs from a company can often get a new life with a robotics project. Aluminium plate and extrusions, bearings, drill bits, wire, connectors, solenoid valves, air cylinders, sprockets, gearboxes, pulleys and belts are all examples of items that can be used. Sometimes a donated part or machine can be sold by the team to raise operating funds. Click the "Materials" button above to get started!</font></td>

				<td> <font size="3" color="black">Some families have financial difficulties covering team fees and travel costs. This is particularly an issue if the team travels to the World Championships in St. Louis, Missouri. Team 2471 does not want to leave anyone behind. A donation of travel funds or airline miles can make a world of difference for a student who has worked all season to achieve their dream trip. Click the "Student" button above to get started!</font></td>
				<td> <font size="3" color="black">In the process of robotics projects there are sometimes activities that the students do not have the tools or skills to do on their own. Services like Welding, Waterjet Cutting, CNC Machining, Precision Machining, PC Board Making, and Web Hosting are some examples of useful services.</font></td>
