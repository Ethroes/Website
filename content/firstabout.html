<a href="http://www.usfirst.org">FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)</a> is a world-wide organization founded 
by Dean Kamen in 1992. FIRST was designed to encourage students to pursue S.T.E.M. related careers 
while instilling a sense of Gracious Professionalism. Gracious Professionalism is the mutual respect of oneself and others within 
the heat of competition. FIRST is built around four levels of robotics competition. <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/jr.fll">Jr.FLL (grades K-3)</a>, 
<a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/fll">FLL (4-8)</a>, 
<a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc">FTC (7-12)</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc">FRC (9-12)</a> enable students of all ages to 
engage in FIRST.

The FIRST Robotics Competition(FRC), which our team competes in, is the &quot;varsity sport of the mind&quot;. 
FRC students have six weeks to design, prototype and build fully functioning competition robots that 
can perform efficently in a challenge based game. The robot must weight no more than 120 pounds, have no larger than a 12V 
power supply, and adhere to several other design criteria to be considered legal for gameplay.
In addition to building a robot, teams must market 
and communicate themselves effectively to one another in order to develop resilient alliances.

Every year, FRC reaches over 78,000 students across 130 different competitions internationally. These students make up the nearly
3,100 teams that will compete for one of the 800 spots at the World Championships in St. Louis, Missouri. To qualify for "Worlds", 
a team must be one of the highest ranked robots in either a regional or district qualification system. Worlds is divided up 
into eight fields with 100 teams each. From each of these eight fields, a winning alliance will emerge to compete in the 
Championship finals.
